# Olympics Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project involves the analysis of Olympics data obtained from Kaggle using various tools and technologies. The analysis is conducted using Python programming language along with Pandas, NumPy, and Streamlit framework. The project is divided into four main parts: Medal Tally Analysis, Overall Analysis, Country-wise Analysis, and Athletes Analysis.

## DataSet Source
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle, a platform for data science and machine learning enthusiasts. The dataset contains information about Olympic events, including details about athletes, countries, sports, and medals won.

## Tools Used
- **PyCharm**: PyCharm is used for web app development, providing a comprehensive environment for Python development with advanced features.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Jupyter Notebook is utilized for analysis purposes, allowing for interactive data exploration and visualization.
- **Python**: Python programming language is the core of this project, providing flexibility and efficiency in data manipulation and analysis.
- **Pandas**: Pandas is a powerful data analysis and manipulation library in Python, used extensively for data preprocessing and analysis tasks.
- **NumPy**: NumPy is a fundamental package for scientific computing with Python, used for numerical computations and array operations.
- **Streamlit**: Streamlit is a framework used for building interactive web applications with Python. It is employed to create the user interface and deploy the analysis results in a web application format.

## Project Parts
1. **Medal Tally Analysis**: Analyzing and visualizing the distribution of medals won by different countries across various Olympic events.
2. **Overall Analysis**: Conducting an overall analysis of the dataset to identify trends, patterns, and insights related to Olympic participation and performance.
3. **Country-wise Analysis**: Examining the performance of individual countries in terms of medal counts, sports participation, and other relevant factors.
4. **Athletes Analysis**: Analyzing the characteristics and performance of individual athletes, including their participation in different events and their success rates.

## Overall Analysis - Top Statistics
In the Overall Analysis part of the project, the following top statistics have been identified:

- **Editions**: Total number of Olympic editions analyzed.
- **Hosts**: Number of different countries that hosted the Olympic Games.
- **Sports**: Total number of sports included in the dataset.
- **Events**: Total number of events over the years.
- **Nations**: Total number of nations represented in the Olympic Games.
- **Athletes**: Total number of athletes participated in the Olympic Games.

## Country-wise Analysis
In the Country-wise Analysis part of the project, the following analyses have been conducted:

- **Medal Tally over the years**: Analysis and visualization of the medal tally of each country over the Olympic editions.
- **Top 10 Athletes of Country**: Identification and ranking of the top 10 athletes of each country based on their performance in the Olympics.
- **Excellence in Particular Sport**: Exploration of countries excelling in particular sports, highlighting their achievements and dominance.

## Athletes Analysis
In the Athletes Analysis part of the project, the following analyses have been conducted:

- **Distribution of Age**: Analysis and visualization of the age distribution of athletes.
- **Distribution of Age with respect to Sports (Gold Medalist)**: Analysis of age distribution among gold medalists across different sports.
- **Height vs Weight Analysis**: Examination of the relationship between height and weight of athletes.
- **Select a Sport**: Interactive selection of a sport to view detailed analysis.
- **Overall**: Overall analysis of athletes' characteristics and participation trends.
- **Men Vs Women Participation over The Year**: Analysis of men vs women participation trends over the years.

## Usage
